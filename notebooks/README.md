# Notebooks & Other experiments

The files in this repo are used to help develop and document schema and schema form generation.

## Hydrogen / Jupyter / IJavascript / IHaskell

Using the package `hydrogen` its possible to connect Atom to a Jupyter notebook. When IJavascript is also installed, it allows to run the `index.js` file in this folder and:
 - setup a watch which renders the generated html form from the MSON schema.
 - use `cmd-option-enter` to reload.
