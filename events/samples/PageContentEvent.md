We do not log data or\ninclude analytics in our websites or applications. When we do operate servers\nto support our applications, they are configured to store as minimal data as\npossible, usually just a username and password, if that is required. We also\nonly recommend third party services, such as [XMPP\nservices](https://www.otr.im/chat.html), [VoIP services](https://ostel.co), or\n[Proxy and VPN providers](https://torproject.org), who abide by these same\npolicies.\n\nIn some cases, when we must distribute our applications through services like\nGoogle Play, our hands our tied and you are at the mercy of their [terms and\npolicies](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms.html). In some cases,\nconvenience trumps privacy, but that is a decision that is up to you. You can\nalways get our apps from our no logging, non-tracking, free and open-source\napp store, [F-Droid](/fdroid).\n\nOtherwise, you can read on below for our general purpose policy around data\nusage and protection policies.\n\n* * *\n\nThis  policy discloses the practices for Guardian Project's website and all\napps and projects we release. It will notify you of the following:\n\n  1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, our apps and services, and how it is used and with whom it may be shared.\n\n  2. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.\n\n  3. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.\n\n  4. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.\n\n**Information Collection, Use, and Sharing**  \nWe are the sole owners of the information collected on this site and our apps.\nWe only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via\nemail, app registration or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or\nrent this information to anyone.\n\nWe will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you\ncontacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside\nof our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request.\n\nUnless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell\nyou about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy\npolicy.\n\n**Your Access to and Control Over Information**  \nYou may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the\nfollowing at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number\ngiven on our website:\n\n• See what data we have about you, if any.\n\n• Change/correct any data we have about you.\n\n• Have us delete any data we have about you.\n\n• Express any concern you have about our use of your data.\n\n**Security**  \nWe take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive\ninformation via the website, your information is protected both online and\noffline.\n\nWherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that\ninformation is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify\nthis by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or\nlooking for \"https\" at the beginning of the address of the web page.\n\nWhile we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online,\nwe also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the\ninformation to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer\nservice) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The\ncomputers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are\nkept in a secure environment.\n\n**Updates**\n\nThis policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on\nthis page.\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n### Learn More\n\nAll of our software is free/libre and open-source on [\n**Github**](https://github.com/guardianproject)  \n  \nReport bugs and track progress on\n[**dev.guardianproject.info**](https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects)  \n  \nOtherwise, please feel free to [**contact us\ndirectly**](https://guardianproject.info/contact/).\n\n### Recent News\n\n  * [OpenArchive: Free &amp; Secure Mobile Media Sharing #DWebSummit](https://guardianproject.info/2016/06/07/openarchive-free-secure-mobile-media-sharing-dwebsummit/)\n  * [Building the most private app store](https://guardianproject.info/2016/06/02/building-the-most-private-app-store/)\n  * [Copperhead, Guardian Project and F-Droid Partner to Build Open, Verifiably Secure Mobile Ecosystem](https://guardianproject.info/2016/03/28/copperhead-guardian-project-and-f-droid-partner-to-build-open-verifiably-secure-mobile-ecosystem/)\n\n### Get Apps\n\n[![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/logo-\nfdroid.png)](https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/) [![](/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2012/07/get_it_on_play_logo_large.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+Guardian+Project)\n[![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/logo-appstore-\nen.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chatsecure-encrypted-\nsecure/id464200063?mt=8)  \n[Download APK files](https://guardianproject.info/releases) or visit [our Apps\npage](/apps) .\n\nLearn how we don't track you and respect your privacy to the utmost through\nour [Data Usage and Protection Policy](/home/data-usage-and-protection-\npolicies/).\n\nThe National Basic Theme by\n[bavotasan.com](https://themes.bavotasan.com/themes/national-wordpress-theme).\n\n`
